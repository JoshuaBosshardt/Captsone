# Captsone
WGU Machine Learning Algorithm Captsone Project

This README will cover the basic functions found within the main.py file of this project and the requirements.

------Function-------
When utilizing the source file 'main.py' understand that there are no catch, exceptions, warnings, or other implementations for faulty data entry
Any entry that does not fit exactly the required commands will result in a fault and crash the python program

Imported libraries which may require additional installation of extensions are listed below:
pandas
seaborn
matplotlib.pyplot
sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
sklearn import preprocessing
sklearn.cluster import KMeans
sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score


To install and run the application, complete the following steps:
1.	Download the main.py file
2.	Download the vgsales.csv file to the designated pathway by importing it directly into the project folder
3.	Open PyCharm Community Edition (all other editions of PyCharm should be acceptable)
4.	Import any necessary libraries listed above into the project
5.	With the project open: if there are errors associated with the above-mentioned libraries, right-click the highlighted sections and give PyCharm permission to download necessary libraries.
6.	Click ‘Run’ in the top right of the IDE to begin running the program.
7.	While the program is running, there will be several prompts to guide you.
8.	Please note: all inputs are case sensitive and there are no error detection mechanisms, any mistyped input will result in the program faulting in error.
9.	Prompt 1 will ask for your input of a specific console, enter your selection in the command window and press the enter key.
10.	Prompt 2 will ask for your input on the available genres for that console that are offered within the database, enter your selection into the command window and press the enter key.
11.	Prompt 3 will ask for your input on the available titles, enter your selection of the title not including the associated numbers attached to the title, only the title itself, and press the enter key.
12.	Prompt 4 will follow the list of the associated clusters based on the selections made in prompts 1, 2, and 3, you will be asked if you are satisfied with the selection or would like to run the search again. In the available space in the command window, enter ‘1’ if you would like to repeat the search or enter ‘0’ if you like to exit the program followed by pressing the enter key.
